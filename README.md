# Developer Tools
Free Developer Tools Developed by Fromdev http://tools.fromdev.com/

This is open source collection of developer tools that can be run on browser. The vision is to have a online tools website where all small tools can be present for developers or freelancers. Most of these tools are developed in JavaScript since we want them to run directly inside the browser. 

I have worked as freelancer for long time and have used many websites for different kind of tools. This project brings best of all tools at one place for free.

The tools can be really small and handy and should help automate repeated work.

# How I Keep It Free and Open Source 
I have two key things that keep me motivated and help these tool running.

1. These tools are deveoped using JavaScript. So No server cost. As long as github allows me to host the website for free.
2. I use these tools everyday so they save me a lot of time. 

# How To Contribute As Developer

# How To Test Your Changes
1. We use Jasmine for doing unit testing on any Javascript functions and utilities.
